# UWP-Conflate

Simple Task Management UWP Application. Offers ToDo List with Reminders.

UWP-Conflate is one of the Presentation Layer applications in the Zevere solution. 

Started with the purpose of learning and experimenting with new technologies, and simply just to code.


## Road Map

As a starting point, Conflate will be a simple UWP application connecting to a RESTful Web API, with a SQLite Data Layer.

## Future steps include: 

* ELK Stack Logging
* Windows Hello
* Kafka
* Speech Interactions using Cortana

and more...
